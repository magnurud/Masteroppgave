# Stopping after userchk

##### Interpreting output
## alph1n - lines 
# found in navier4.f subroutine projh()
how much reduction of the residual is attained. 

L1/L2 DIV(V): total divergence in l1 and l2 space.
QTL : Thermal divergence

# DT line
The two last variables are total time and time/timestep

# Explosion from the beguinning
Too high timestep

# Running interactively on vilje 
qsub -I  -A ntnu100 -l select=2:ncpus=32:mpiprocs=16 -l walltime=01:00:00

# WARNINGb: Detected non-right-handed element.
Redo the mesh in ICEM!
Make the surfmesh finer! 

# Error in jacobians etc. 
Make sure nodes are projected onto surface in ICEM

# Declaration of variables
Be absolutely sure that all variables are declared,
Fortran throws no error message. 
First SIZE, then TOTAL etc, then NEKUSE

# OUTPUT FIELDS! 
Need at least 5 lines!! 

# boundary condition error
Error reading initial condition/drive force data
aborting in routine rdicdf.
EXIT: rdicdf error          1

FIX ::: Remove thermal BC's

# Compressing multiple files 
cat file1 file2 file3* | gzip > files.gz

# Renaming all files in folder 
rename 's/foo/bar/g' * -vn #preview of foo -> bar
rename 's/foo/bar/g' * -v #doing foo -> bar

#making surface mesh 
Choose patch independent

##make nastranmesh file from ICEM 
create the parameter input file
touch filename.par
------------------------------
##fix refinements:
edit mesh
	merge nodes
		merge meshes
			resolve refinements

-----------------------------
##Adjust parameter nfldmax in SIZE file to enable 
##more output parameters in hpts

The size of the work array is decided in the beginning of the function htps
Have to change this definition of nflds as well! 
Adding extra parameter nfldextra in SIZE file, Need to be adjusted manually 
for different output

-----------------------------
##Plotting in Visit
PSeudocolor
	operator, slicer,slice, redraw
		OpAtts slicing, slicer

----------------------------
fix Xorg high CPU-usage
	download compizconfig-settings-manager
		uncheck OpenGL --> Sync to VBlanc 
		set Texture filter = Fast
----------------------------
Always check if mesh has unwanted curvature !! 

# Vilje
Had to add extra flag to use mpif77 on vilje!

# Husk filending i ICEM! 
O : Outflow
V : inflow
S or SYM : Symmetry
W : Wall
