Many numerical solvers for turbulent flows are available on the market.
From large commercial softwares such as Fluent which runs as a 
black-box solver, to full open-source codes such as Nek5000 and OpenFOAM. 
The solvers can vary in the numerical method; Finite volume, Finite Difference, 
Finite Element, Spectral Element etc., the particular algorithm 
for resolving the pressure-velocity coupling, for instance fractional step, pressure correction, 
inexact factorization and Uzawa.
The type of simulation available also varies from solver to solver, whether
they apply RANS, LES, DNS or a variety of these. Although most solvers offer multiple of the settings
listed above it is important to be aware of their strengths and weaknesses before choosing which 
one to use. This chapter is devoted to the handling of Nek5000, and can serve
as a brief introduction to the code.

\section{Nek5000 basics}

Nek5000 is a flow solver developed mainly by Paul Fischer
and has through the past 20 years had several contributors. 
It is an open-source code applicable to many different types of flow 
and it has been put a lot of effort into the parallelization of the code, 
guaranteeing optimal speedup. All the parallelization is accessed through subroutines
and functions, enabling the user to make advanced functions without having to 
deal directly with the MPI library.
With SEM as the numerical method applied it is possible to obtain very accurate results.  

%nek5000 has its own mesh-generator for generating simpler geometries and it is also implemented the possibility to integrate CUBIT mesh 
%files. A common starting point for simulating turbulent flow is a geometry given by a CAD-file,
%without any functions to describe the boundaries.
%The possibility to make a mesh through a visual gui is provided through for instance ICEM.
%This mesh can then later be transformed to the inputfile required by Nek5000. 

Nek5000 provides some basic tools for generation of mesh. For more complex geometries this tool cannot compare with more visual softwares 
such as ICEM from ANSYS that exports mesh to several numerical solvers such as Fluent and Nastran.
An automatic way of converting a mesh created in ICEM to the format required by Nek5000 is therefore very useful. 
The way the mesh is created in this thesis is visualized in \fref{fig:mesh}.
%
\begin{figure}[h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{Figures/mesh2.pdf}
	\caption{Visualization of how the mesh is created. The elemental mesh is first generated using ICEM, the script mshconvert
    converts this to a .rea-file and finally the distribution of the GLL-nodes is done during the initialization in Nek5000}
	\label{fig:mesh}
\end{figure}
%
%In order for Nek5000 to run optimally the elements should be as homogenous and as similar to the reference element as possible. 
%It is therefore of great interest to be able to propagate curved geometries into the neighbour-elements in order to have a smooth as 
%possible transition from a boundary with high curvature.

So far Nek5000 has supported three automatic routines for generating curved edges;
circles in 2-D geometries, spherical shell elements and a general 2nd degree interpolation.
Further manipulation of the element edges is left to the user to define manually in \verb|usrdat2|
for each particular problem. One of the objectives of this thesis is to make Nek5000 more
user-friendly and create automatic routines to handle complex geometry. Before the work regarding
the mesh routines are further elaborated an overview of the file structure will be presented.

\section{Editable files}

	\label{fig:files}
\end{figure}
%
Working with Nek5000 requires knowledge to some practicalities.
The program is recompiled for every case and the user specify all the necessary  
information in the three files \verb|{.rea,.usr,SIZE}|. \verb|.usr| and \verb|SIZE| are 
compiled with the standard Nek5000 library using makenek which creates the executable file \verb|nek5000|,
they can be considered the surface and the core of the entire program. 
The \verb|.rea| file contains case-specific information read during the initialization of the 
compiled program. The user guide \cite{Nek} contains a tutorial that explains the necessary 
steps on how to get started with Nek5000. The next chapters will try to give some understanding on 
how the user is able to make the changes necessary for each case. \fref{fig:files} illustrates 
how the files work together. 
%
\subsection{SIZE}
Since Nek5000 is mostly based on Fortran77 all memory allocations are done statically and must be specified explicitly 
before runtime. Most of the variables used to determine the memory usage are stated in \verb|SIZE|.
The size of the working arrays necessary to perform the calculations are mostly defined by the upper limits of elements, 
processors, scalars and of course the polynomial degree
of the local Lagrange functions. These variables define the sizes of almost all 
the arrays used in the program so it is important to define these variables as accurately 
as possible to optimize memory usage. The \verb|SIZE| file can be considered as the necessary base 
of Nek5000.

%
In \verb|.rea| all the problem specific parameters are given. While the content in \verb|SIZE| 
is an absolute necessity to even compile the program, \verb|.rea| contains variables 
that are not used until the initialization of the case. The structure of the file is given in \tref{tab:reafile}.
Of the 103 variables specified in the beginning of the file there are roughly 50 of them that are used. 
Note that apart from the mesh information \verb|.rea| restricts itself to single variables and boolean flags 
while \verb|.usr| needs to be applied for more advanced implementations. 
\subsection{.usr}
This file contains a series of standard routines open for modification by the user. In addition the user is free to specify 
new routines if needed. A description of these routines are given in the Nek5000 User manual~\cite{Nek}. A list of those 
frequently used for this thesis are described below, 
%routines used for this thesis are stated in \tref{tab:userfile}.

    \item \verb|usrdat2| - Project the geometry onto a deformed general surface. The details of how this routine is used will be

\end{itemize}
%
In addition to these routines all user-defined functions are specified in this file. The LES implementation in Nek5000 is based
on several subroutines in addition to those stated above. A list of some of the variables and functions 
applied for the implementations in this thesis are stated in Appendix~\ref{AppendixB}.
The \verb|.usr| file can be considered as the surface of Nek5000, easily accessible for the user.

\section{The basics of the solver}
The most important building blocks in Nek5000 are the \verb|fluid| and \verb|heat| functions that solves the 
N-S and passive scalar equations. The N-S solver works in different ways depending on the mathematical formulation
enabled whereas the PS equation, which does not depend on the pressure, is solved similarly for $P_NP_N$ and $P_NP_{N-2}$. 
For the sake of clarity, \fref{fig:files} shows how the algorithms are called from the main routine.
This is a simplified flow chart that does not include choices such as filters, preconditioners, LES-model, 
de-aliasing etc. but it explains how the two main algorithms are selected using the boolean variable \verb|ifsplit|.

	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Figures/Nek.pdf}
	\caption{Visualization of the steps in Nek5000.}
	\label{fig:files}
\end{figure}
%

The description of the routines corresponding to discrete splitting and fractional step are found in 
\cref{prescorr} and~\ref{fracstep}. For further details regarding the 
implementation in Nek5000 it is referred to \cite{Fischer_hybridschwarz-multigrid}
and \cite{TomboulidesPnPn}.

As mentioned before an important difference between these two implementations is the fact that the $P_NP_N$ 
implementation is based on an analytical splitting algorithm, while the $P_NP_{N-2}$ formulation is based on 
a splitting of the discrete scheme. The boundary condition of the pressure Poisson equation in the fractional step method
is often mentioned as a major difference between these two schemes, and a reason to choose the latter.
It is however stated and proved in for instance~\cite{Guermond2006} that the discrete splitting also
introduces an erroneous boundary condition weakly.

%To best understand the work flow of Nek5000 the subroutine \verb|nek_advance| in \verb|drive1.f| should be examined.
%This routine includes all the steps in one iteration of the solver. The routine is adapted so that it is functional
%for a number of different problems and user defined settings. The most important boolean switches used in this routine are 
%described in the list below 
%
%\begin{itemize}
    %\item ifsplit - whether the $\mathbb{P}_N-\mathbb{P}_N$ or the $\mathbb{P}_N-\mathbb{P}_{N-2}$ is to be used.
    %\item iftrans - transient or steady flow.
    %\item ifheat - solving for heat.
    %\item ifnav - natural convection for the scalar fields (Boolean array)
    %\item param(103) - activation of filtering.
%\end{itemize}
%%
%further the routines of interests are \verb|fluid| and \verb|heat|, the solvers for N-S equations and passive scalars respectively.
%Both subroutines are found in \verb|drive2.f|. The understanding of these solvers are best achieved by studying equation  \eref{eq:NS} 
%and \eref{eq:PS}. For the settings chosen in this thesis a fractional step procedure as described in 
%\cref{fracstep} is applied.

%
%\section{Incompressible N-S solvers in Nek}
%Nek5000 offer several implementations depending on the mathematical formulation wanted by the user.
%The most standard, and the algorithm applied in this thesis is the fractional step procedure 
%described in detail in \cref{description}.


%A Convection-Diffusion problem can be stated as 
%\begin{align}
    %M\frac{du}{dt} = Au-Cu+Mf
    %\label{eq:conv-diff}
%\end{align}
%% 
%Where $M$ and $A$ is the mass, and stiffness matrix, $f$ is the loading function and $C$ is 
%the matrix corresponding to the convective term. The non-linearity is represented in the 
%convective term since $C$ is dependent of $u$.
%The time-derivative is discretized by a Backward difference (BDFk) scheme using solutions 
%from the $k$ previous steps to extrapolate the current value. In order to gain stability 
%an implicit scheme is chosen and the resulting eguation is given as 
%%
%OIFS ???
%---------- CHECK MAKEF IN NAVIER1.F ----------------- 
%\begin{align}
    %\sum_{j=0}^{k}\frac{b_j}{\Delta t}Mu^{n-j+1} = Au^{n+1}-Cu^{n+1}+Mf^{n+1}
    %\label{eq:conv-diff2}
%\end{align}
%% 
%By extrapolating the convective term from the $k$ previously calculated steps the equation 
%simplifies to 
%%
%\begin{align}
   %\frac{b_0}{\Delta t}Mu^{n+1} \sum_{j=1}^{k}\frac{b_j}{\Delta t}Mu^{n-j+1} 
   %= Au^{n+1}-\sum_{j=1}^{k}a_jCu^{n-j+1}+Mf^{n+1}
    %\label{eq:conv-diff3}
%\end{align}
%% 
%and finally by moving all the explicit terms to the rhs the equation left to solve is given as 
%%
%\begin{align}
   %(\frac{b_0}{\Delta t}M-A)u^{n+1} 
   %= -\sum_{j=1}^{k}(\frac{b_j}{\Delta t}M-a_jC)u^{n-j+1}+Mf^{n+1}
    %\label{eq:conv-diff4}
%\end{align}
%% 
%Notice from Section~\ref{theory} that this is equivalent to the matrix formulation of 
%the Helmholtz equation.



\section{Nek5000 for complex geometries}
Nek5000 has its own mesh generator \textit{prenek} that allows the user to define geometries 
and curves using analytical expressions. This tool does however have limited visual support, and
can not compare with for instance ICEM when working with more complex geometries. 

For curved geometries that can be expressed analytically such as bent cylinders, ellipsoids etc. 
the recommended procedure is to project the points of interest onto the surface
in \verb|usrdat2|. Even for a simple shape such as a sphere some implementation
has to be done and it demands that the user has knowledge to Fortran77 and the structure of Nek5000.
The necessary implementation consists of two steps 
%
\begin{enumerate}
    \item determine the faces that belong to the deformed surface
    \item project the predefined GLL-points onto the deformed surface
\end{enumerate}
%
This can be done without too much work for shapes with a known analytical 
expression such as a cylinder or a sphere, but for some general CAD geometry 
it is no way to perform this projection routine. This is a vulnerable point 
for a SEM solver since the elements generated by the mesh are relatively coarse.
Many Finite volume based solvers do not support curved elements simply because the 
complex geometries are resolved with a sufficiently high resolution and it 
is of no interest to approximate them any better. However for a spectral element
solver it is necessary to address this problem since spectral convergence 
for the approximated solution in $P_N$ is not achievable 
if the geometry is only represented in $P_{1}$ or $P_{2}$.

\subsection{converting mesh from ICEM to Nek5000}

For more advanced geometry it is considered a necessity to have some visual mesh generator.
In this thesis all of the meshes have been made in ICEM and then converted using the python 
script \verb|mshconvert| as illustrated in~\fref{fig:mesh}. Since a lot 
of the work done regarding the mesh was done based on this script a brief description will be 
given here.

ICEM is able to write mesh files for many different solvers, including Fluent and Nastran. 
The original \verb|mshconvert| script can take any of these two formats as input and write a 
corresponding \verb|.rea| file with a predefined parameter list. It supports curved 
edges by applying the midpoint notation, and all velocity boundary conditions available in Nek5000.
It also has a propagation parameter for a cylinder, this allows element edges inside
the domain to be affected by the curvature of the geometry. The idea is that a smooth 
transition of the element deformation, will improve the Jacobians and lead to better accuracy.
