\section{Navier-Stokes equation}

The physics regarding fluids in motion are described mathematically by the Navier-Stokes equation. The equations can be derived in many ways, 
and it is referred to \cite{White} for a complete explication. The general idea is to conserve momentum and mass in a control domain and by 
applying Reynolds transport theorem and the result is the following two equations reffered to as the N-S equations. 

\begin{align}
	\frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + (\mathbf{u}\cdot \nabla)\mathbf{u} &= -\nabla p + \nu \nabla \cdot \tau \\
		\nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{u}) &= 0
	\label{eq:NS}
\end{align}

These equations have been studied for centuries and different physical situations lead to different simplifications and sets of equations. 
Examples are the Euler equations, Stokes problem, darcy flow and the incompressible navier-stokes equations. 
Without doing the derivation of the equations a short discussion of each term in equation N-S will be given here in order to understand there
physical origin and their mathematical attributes. 

The term $\partial \mathbf{u} /\partial t$  is the time-derivative of the flow, for a steady state flow this term will be equal zero.
The discretization of this term is often based on some implicit scheme.  

The convective term $(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) \mathbf{u}$ describes the transport due to the flow itself on each of its components. 
This term is non-linear and does therefore require the equations to be solved by some iteration procedure such as Newton iterations.

The diffusive term $\nu \Delta \mathbf{u}$ describes the natural diffusion of the fluid. The effect of diffusion is determined by the 
viscosity of the fluid. Mathematically this term makes the equations numerically stable and it is therefore generally easier
to solve the N-S equations for high-viscosity fluids. 

The pressure gradient $\nabla p$ is the only term involving the pressure, \ldots DISCUST THE MEANING OF PRESSURE\ldots 
in modern solution techniques it is common to solve eq. \ref{eq:NS} 
in a decoupled manner. 

The reynolds stress tensor $\tau = \cdots$ is the turbulent term of the N-S equation. In laminar flow this term can 
be neglected.

The second equation in \ref{eq:NS} imposes a divergence free constraint on the solution $\mathbf{u}$ if the fluid is 
assumed to be incombressible. The density $\rho$ will be a constant and the simplification follows trivially.

The coefficient $\nu$ is the inverse Reynolds number $1/Re$. The reynolds number can be understood in many different ways, but perhaps the most 
import role is that it describes the relation between the biggest length scales of the flow and the viscous length scales. Turbulent flows are
characterized by high reynolds number. The huge span in length scales requires an extremely fine mesh if the equations \ref{eq:NS} 
are to be solved exactly. Because a fine mesh implies a high computational cost a direct numerical solution (DNS) is not feasible for 
problems of a certain complexity.

\begin{itemize}
\item The time-derivative
\item The convective term 
\item The diffusive term 
\item The pressure gradient
\item The reynolds stress tensor
\item The reynolds number
\item The mass equation
\end{itemize}


\section{Resolving the turbulent term}
Depending on the wanted accuracy of your solution and the number of computational units at hand the turbulent term can be solved in 
different ways. A brief overview of the different approaches to the turbulent term are discussed in the following subsections

\begin{itemize}
	\item Laminar flow
	\item RANS
	\item LES
	\item K-epsilon and K-omega
	\item DNS
\end{itemize}

\section{Solution methods of incombressible N-S}
A non-linear set of equations requires a non-trivial solution method, and when the domain of the problem can be anyting from a simple channel 
to a moving turbine there are many considerations that needs to be made. Allthough the equations have been known for over 200 years no one 
has been able to prove or disprove the well-posedness of the problem. FINAL ELEMENT FORMULATION WELL-POSED?? Some of the most common algorithms 
will be discussed in the following subsections

\begin{itemize}
\item coupled versus decoupled 
\item The Uzawa algorithm 
\item Pressure correction method
\item fractional step method
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Decoupling the pressure} 

A common way to approach equation~\ref{eq:NS} is to solve the pressure and velocity field
seperatly. The mathematical reasoning for this approach is obtained by taking the 
divergence on both sides, 

\begin{align}
	\nabla \cdot \frac{\partial \mathbf{u}}{\partial t} + 
    \nabla \cdot(\mathbf{u} \cdot \nabla) \mathbf{u} 
    &= -\Delta p + \nu \Delta \tau \\
	\frac{\partial (\nabla \cdot  \mathbf{u})}{\partial t} + 
    (\nabla \cdot \mathbf{u}) \cdot \nabla \mathbf{u} 
    &= -\Delta p + \nu \Delta \tau \\
   \Delta p &= \nu \Delta \tau \\
	\label{eq:pressuredecoupling}
\end{align}

Where the divergence free criterium is applied to get to the final equation.
